# [Meetinghellbingo.com](https://meetinghellbingo.com?ref=github)

It's a website which lets you play bingo with common meeting cliches and faux pas.

## Collection of squares clicked

I intend to publish some stats on which of these people clicked the most. I collect a bit of data for this, and I use [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com) because they don't collect any personally identifiable information, only the event of what was clicked.

## Fork it, use it

I wrote this as a quick idea. It works, but it's a bit rough and hacky. Feel free to use it for whatever bingo cards you might want to set up yourself. If you fix any bugs though, please do a PR upstream to this repo too!

## Contributing

If you've got a bingo square to add, feel free to submit a PR!
